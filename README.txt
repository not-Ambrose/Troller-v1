Troller is a bot that allows you to spam discord.
Token.txt contains the token needed to spam.
The invite link is for inviting the bot to your sever. 
IMPORTANT: PHANTOM.EXE MUST BE RUNNING ON YOUR PC WITH THE TOKEN INPUTTED. 
After phantom.exe has been launched, and the token has been entered, you need to invite the bot. 
This invite link can be found on the token.txt file. 
After you have finished all the steps, you run "$deadz" in the channel that you want to spam in.
